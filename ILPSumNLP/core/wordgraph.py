:Description:
    takahe is a multi-sentence compression module. Given a set of redundant 
    sentences, a word-graph is constructed by iteratively adding sentences to 
    it. The best compression is obtained by finding the shortest path in the
    word graph. The original algorithm was published and described in
    [filippova:2010:COLING]_. A keyphrase-based reranking method, described in
    [boudin-morin:2013:NAACL]_ can be applied to generate more informative 
    compressions.

:History:
    Development history of the takahe module:
        - 0.4 (Mar. 2013) adding the keyphrase-based nbest reranking algorithm
        - 0.33 (Feb. 2013), bug fixes and better code documentation
        - 0.32 (Jun. 2012), Punctuation marks are now considered within the 
          graph, compressions are then punctuated
        - 0.31 (Nov. 2011), modified context function (uses the left and right 
          contexts), improved docstring documentation, bug fixes
        - 0.3 (Oct. 2011), improved K-shortest paths algorithm including 
          verb/size constraints and ordered lists for performance
        - 0.2 (Dec. 2010), removed dependencies from nltk (i.e. POS-tagging, 
          tokenization and stopwords removal)
        - 0.1 (Nov. 2010), first version

:Dependencies:
    The following Python modules are required:
        - `networkx <http://networkx.github.com/>`_ for the graph construction
          (v1.2+)

:Usage:
    A typical usage of this module is::
    
        import takahe
        
        # A list of tokenized and POS-tagged sentences
        sentences = ['Hillary/NNP Clinton/NNP wanted/VBD to/stop visit/VB ...']
        
        # Create a word graph from the set of sentences with parameters :
        # - minimal number of words in the compression : 6
        # - language of the input sentences : en (english)
        # - POS tag for punctuation marks : PUNCT
        compresser = takahe.word_graph( sentences, 
                                        nb_words = 6, 
                                        lang = 'en', 
                                        punct_tag = "PUNCT" )

        # Get the 50 best paths
        candidates = compresser.get_compression(50)

        # 1. Rerank compressions by path length (Filippova's method)
        for cummulative_score, path in candidates:

            # Normalize path score by path length
            normalized_score = cummulative_score / len(path)

            # Print normalized score and compression
            print round(normalized_score, 3), ' '.join([u[0] for u in path])

        # Write the word graph in the dot format
        compresser.write_dot('test.dot')

        # 2. Rerank compressions by keyphrases (Boudin and Morin's method)
        reranker = takahe.keyphrase_reranker( sentences,  
                                              candidates, 
                                              lang = 'en' )

        reranked_candidates = reranker.rerank_nbest_compressions()

        # Loop over the best reranked candidates
        for score, path in reranked_candidates:
            
            # Print the best reranked candidates
            print round(score, 3), ' '.join([u[0] for u in path])

:Misc:
    The Takahe is a flightless bird indigenous to New Zealand. It was thought to
    be extinct after the last four known specimens were taken in 1898. However, 
    after a carefully planned search effort the bird was rediscovered by on 
    November 20, 1948. (Wikipedia, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/takahe)

        Constructs a directed word graph from the list of input sentences. Each

        - Word mapping/creation is done in four steps:

            1. non-stopwords for which no candidate exists in the graph or for 
               which an unambiguous mapping is possible or which occur more than
               once in the sentence

            2. non-stopwords for which there are either several possible
               candidates in the graph

            3. stopwords

            4. punctuation marks

        For the last three groups of words where mapping is ambiguous we check 
        the immediate context (the preceding and following words in the sentence 
        and the neighboring nodes in the graph) and select the candidate which 
        has larger overlap in the context, or the one with a greater frequency 
        (i.e. the one which has more words mapped onto it). Stopwords are mapped 
        only if there is some overlap in non-stopwords neighbors, otherwise a 
        new node is created. Punctuation marks are mapped only if the preceding 
        and following words in the sentence and the neighboring nodes are the
        same.

        - Edges are then computed and added between mapped words.
        
        Each node in the graph is represented as a tuple ('word/POS', id) and 
        possesses an info list containing (sentence_id, position_in_sentence)
        tuples.
